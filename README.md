# Online_News_SQL-Project
This mini project aims to fetch news by API to create a database and apply to SQL for analysis

1) The News_fetch_SQL python notebook demonstrates how I get news by API key and some keywords to build up a database for later on SQL use
2) The News_fetch_SQL sql file shows the analysis process of the database created above
3) The database 'news_articles.db' is also uploaded for people who want to practice along:) 
4) note: the data is collected from 2023/04/28 - 2023/05/29
